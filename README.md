codeschool-intellij
===================

This is a theme in the spirit* of the Codeschool theme for Vim, found at [AstonJ's website](http://astonj.com/tech/vim-for-ruby-rails-and-a-sexy-theme/).

The theme here is geared towards IntelliJ IDEA use, and is recommended for users of the Darcula skin, or those that
prefer dark themes in general.

Supported IDEs
==============

 - IntelliJ IDEA (tested with version 13 and 14)
 - 0xDBE (tested with EAP releases

Known to work with
==================

  - RubyMine
  - PyCharm

 
If your IDE isn't listed, the theme will *likely* work; simply follow the installation instructions below.
If you run into errors, please file a bug, and I'll see to it getting fixed.


How to Build
============

As of version 0.5, we provide the Gradle Wrapper for you to use.

Navigate to the `gradle/` directory, and run this command:

 - Linux/OS X:

        ./gradlew jar


 - Windows:

        gradlew.bat jar


...and you should have the working copy in your build/libs directory.

The JAR will be named with respect to the last tagged version, along with the Git commit that it used to build.  For example:  if you build the JAR, you might see this for a file name:

    codeschool-intellij-v0.5-b92f713.jar


How to Install
==============

Under File > Import Settings, navigate to the folder in which the JAR was built.  Import the color theme from it.


How to Contribute
=================

If you make a change to the theme, navigate to File > Export Settings.  Only select "Color schemes".
 
Drop your changes into the working directory of the project (that is, unjar the archive generated by your IDE), and submit a patch request.

If you want to file a bug, please include the name of the JAR that was generated - this will help in isolating when a particular bug/regression was introduced.
