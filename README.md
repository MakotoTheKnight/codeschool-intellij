codeschool-intellij
===================

This is a port of the Codeschool theme for Vim, found at [AstonJ's website](http://astonj.com/tech/vim-for-ruby-rails-and-a-sexy-theme/).

The theme here is geared towards IntelliJ IDEA use, and is recommended for users of the Darcula skin, or those that
prefer dark themes in general.

Supported IDEs
==============

 - IntelliJ IDEA (tested with version 13)
 - 0xDBE (tested with EAP releases)
 
 If your IDE isn't listed, the theme will *likely* work; simply follow the installation instructions below.
 If you run into errors, please file a bug, and I'll see to it getting fixed.


How to Build
============

This project uses Gradle to assemble the JAR.  As of version 0.5, we provide the Gradle Wrapper (v. 1.9) for you to use.

Once it's on your classpath, run the task:

    gradle jar

...and you should have the working copy in your build/libs directory.


How to Install
==============

Under File > Import Settings, navigate to the folder in which the JAR was built.  Import the color theme from it.


How to Contribute
=================

If you make a change to the theme, navigate to File > Export Settings.  Only select "Color schemes".
 
Drop your changes into the working directory of the project (that is, unjar the archive generated by your IDE), and submit a patch request.
